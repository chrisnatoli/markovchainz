I think I’m Malcolm X, Martin Luther
Add a King, add a Junior
Some Bible verses, a couple Sunnahs
An AK-47, that’s a revolution
Then, think I’m 2Pac, Bob Marley
Fela Kuti, Marcus Garvey
Them the real ones, light a lighter for ‘em
Let you know that I’m riding for ‘em

Gonna get me some, a little more beat
Call your friends around, then call the police
I’m riding with my flow, it take up 4 seats
So I’m gonna ghostride - but with no sheets
One man by myself even then I’m 4 deep
Like hotel swimming pools that’s 4 feet
These niggas like the rooms: so suite
Priceline: so cheap
I’m a cell phone, they some room keys
I’m some shell toes, they the shoestrings
I turn ‘em off (I turn ‘em off)
I take ‘em out (I take ‘em out)
I’m Reverend Run, with the laces out
My Adidas, so adios
"All Day I Dream" like I’m comatose
That’s your ship sinking, and I’m so afloat
I’m T-Pain, I’m on a boat
Not the slave one, DiCaprio’s, neither
Here the waves come, they started in the bleachers
So I’m swag surfin', the pool’s getting deeper
You still sweet, though, here come them roomkeepers
Okay, I be the strings, you be the shoes
But guess what? Now they Jimmy Choos
I wear the pants, you in the Poohs
Yo’ shit meows, my shit awoooooos
I got a fifth floor, call me Brother Man
Africa the set, yeah, that’s the Motherland
For that BP I shed 50 tears
In Nigeria that oil been spilling for like 50 years
“50 years? Hell naw!”
Hell yeah! I’m tryna tell y’all
At this rate, niggas gonna lose
Can’t search for water or grow your own food
Tell me what’s gonna happen when them stores close
And ain’t gon’ open up no more?
That’s the realest shit, yeah, you gon’ feel that
Hunger’s your enemy, but you can’t kill that
Nigga, wake up, don’t join the Army
Kill your own peoples, but fear Illuminatis
And they ain’t even real, or are they?
But you wouldn’t even know, because you partay
Too fucking much, if you start to doubt
They already in your mind, and coming out your mouth
It’s not a trick, nigga, it’s a trap
"Survival of the Fit" is what they aiming at
And niggas ain’t fit (nope), fat as hell (yep)
Fat in mind (yep), body fat as well
Who use most the drugs? Americans!
What’s in Afghanistan? Heroin!
You think that’s by mistake? They can stop that?
Don’t think you safe though, because you not black
Greed is colorblind, so I’m colorblind
They gon’ fuck with yours soon as they done with mine
They say I try too hard, verses overwhelm
I learned most of this from niggas sitting in jail
Where you think I’m from? From the streets, nigga
Triple OGs, told me to teach, nigga
And that ain’t made up, that’s a fact
They say that gangsta shit, is the shit I rap
Look who I attract, look at my inner circle
Buncha street niggas, and a couple Urkels
Look at my fan base, oh, yes
Fuck what Pro say, look at this protest
Where they do that at? (Huh?) Who they do that for? (Who?)
Must mean I’m doing bad, and things is moving slow
They talking revolution on public radio
They catch down in Houston, sitting on them 84s
Trae, what’s up? ABN
Got your back, nigga, sink or swim
Free Chilly Chill, shake off your masters
Pray to God, build your mind faster

Say is this home
Widely received, whenever I touchdown
Call me Young Touchdown, nothin' deeper than the end zone
I had a good year, like the blimp Ice Cube's a pimp on
I lips poem, the same blocks where I mad everything rock like Flintstones
Drop with the rims on, clock with the gemstones
Can't call it like blocks on a Sprint phone
Flow incredible, remember, L-U-P-Emperor
Nickname December, move birds like winter
Mind on my tender, move words like verb
Drop lines like "enter"
Go on and get it Crunk
I ain't really gotta jump like centers
Wait, while you popping and panicking
Peep the demeanor that I'm standing in
Like I'm mocking a mannequin
Don't think its fluff cause the pampering
I'm still ruff like the unpaid man
Like the unpaved Madison
Straight where I stay like dogs that don't move
Obedient school made me so cool
I was so unruly
I used to chase cars, run behind female dogs
Wouldn't sit with shit
Now you cats can't move me

I'm a chaser
And niggas tryin' to take me off my paper
Like erasers
Let me put you on to somethin'
All I got is the other end for them
And their brother men that wanna get it bubblin'
It's nothing
So be clear
Like I'll pretend that me here
Not just help a friend, believe it
But if you feel you need it
Then I can be your last one like Jesus
With the ease to speak your English
You could be as hard as sign language with no fingers
Drama for the Domas, sky it so it lingers
And you'll never forget, like elephants
Thought you had yourself a slippa, like Cinderella prince
But instead you got yourself pimpa
Who wasn't hesitant to help yo limp like impotence Jack
Viagra to be more exact, Emperor to Emgera
Perhaps I rap to much on the issue
It's back to my ritual
We'll be back
If I happen to miss you
Clappin' the pistol
Burning like clap when you piss dude
Laughin' a little

Catch me I'm balling, catch me I'm balling
Catch me like Spalding, catch me like Rawlings
If he indeed the MC, vitamin like GNC
Can't see me like BIG on CMT
Did a little bit of time on BMG
But this right here homie, this all me
Can you be down, nah, nigga C.M.B
That's cold, that ain't nice G
So what though, little homie remind me of Ice-T
By the way we share the same birthday
The word play is work but pimping is easy
So catch me I'm balling
I'm sick too if you ain't catch me like coughing
Back when I said you should catch me like Rawlings
It's cool, cause most cats that I bump into can't catch me that often
Most times they just end up falling
Ball for a few then end up walking
Catch me in the ball with a Cinderella waltzing
And I do it until it's no longer exclusive
Might go once, might go twice
But never three times like an auction to it
See I, walk into it, I do my thang
And tell a homie that it's cool to let y'all into it

My mind remain on gunplay
While y'all niggas sleep like Jermaine on Sunday
The heat stay packed like the train on Monday
Yes, I lick off the time you gotta be there, (nine)
Push by the time that you get off (five)
And I pump 8's till I reach lunch break (twelve)
It's bout the time that you get home (that's six)
That's the gist homes
That's the unofficial master plan
Minus any unforeseen traffic jams
Like my songs carrying the clubs like Bagger Vance
Or getting' caught by them long arms
Like Mr. Fantastic damn
But I can't fade like Fantastic Sams and taper off
I'm a better nigga man this is Edward Scissorhands with my back against the wall
Till I'm a V12 6er I'm a 130-round clipper
As if I was Elton Brand
But I could never leave Chicago
Unless heavily cargo, my jeans heavily argo
My stride is stiff see I rides as if
I don't need a helpin' hand, uh
Pride is this, never you see I is content
I'm slick I slde, I don't slip I ride
Don't flip I grind when the shit hits the fan
Like a line drive into the stands
The shoe fits the foot the mitt fits the hand
Misfits hollow tips hits ya man
Swallow nicks when dicks hit the land like
Snoop Dogg in his wheelchair
But I'm comin' from the Chi
And I flip pies
3 14-inch rims and they runnin' on the side
West that is, yes, F to the I (West Side) throw it up
Now back to the pies
Wasn't talking 'bout Snoop Dogg's wheels there
I am Farrahkahn with the Heroin
Salvatore Ferragamo on my feet
Pair of charms 'round my neck
Skeleton Vacheron on my arm
Gangsta, runnin the streets like marathon
With 26 Ks now lemme break it down I'm the leader of the pack
That's hard to believe if you fatiguin' in the back
I'm back to the master plan
I'm up front with the Africans
They swallow birds like Sylvester
It's the French connector Cooperstown collector
Yessuh my lifestyle's the shit
They shit lifestyles of that shit
Yeah
To sum it up I'm having a nice run
You have a nice one
Peace!

A lot of niggas be playin' the fool
And I ain't havin' that shit like prayin' in school
I'm gonna keep more tools than True Values that I know how to use
I don't need "how to's"
Nigga's don't believe they can bleed or bruise
That's why solo niggas always leave in two's
Weed and booze'll have nigga's leaking from wounds
Ain't no comin' back home, Mom's leasin' your room
Nigga's will lose their grins when it's Lupe and friends
And them orange juice Timb's in a foregin coupe that swims
Now a days emcee's be wildin'
And my mic check be better than they whole album
They wonder why they can't touch it
Cause my shit stay over there head like carry on luggage
I'd give it to any performer on any budget
The rhyme in the I am niggas want nothin' of it

You got to, accept the troubles, it's not like it's hard
Yeah no choice but to, accept the troubles, it's not like it's hard
You know you got to, accept the troubles, it's not like it's hard
Accept the troubles nigga, live with it
You got to, accept the troubles, it's not like it's hard
Yeah, listen, yeah

I'm never blunted
Cause table's can turn like 1200s
But I keep a 'three-eight' on that burn next to my stomach
Shells punished concerned well from it
Cause I learn customers return if the product is humming
Yo it's Was, one hundred will walk for duke
Runnin' best believe them bullets be in hot pursuit
Especially don't pull it dawg it's not for you
You dressed up like prom and deaded I'm the alarm
I got Winter in my grill and Summer in my palms
And numbers on your Moms dumb and dumbers for the strong
I know them bars is hurting cause I'm a hard working dark child
Like R. Jerkins I see the sharks lurkin', honest, hungry
CCF sponser the alumni and rep Madison constant money
I'm a fast learner with a fast burner
And I hope you can fast, cause there's no eating when it's my turn to

Am I what you expected, the good die young and I've been resurrected
The hood's my son, I'm quite impressive
Best believe it's yayo with WJ Goals and them writin' credits
Yo, I mouth piece niggas swearing ya tough
And you're that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
And that 8-40 hoody with the wooden guts
With the AK 4-fully that'll cook you and ya tux
Ya ain't thorough, you got it mixed up like Dourough
Just cause they in suits that don't mean they the Bureau
Your small time so close to worthless
Only feds at your house is the Postal Service
It's all love why try and hate us
Don't make me call thugs
And you shook like vibrators
Head shots to ruin your linings and tapers
We hustlas flip cane like five Phi Thetas
Understand nigga

Wishes that the world could see
From the position of my girl and me
From the perspective of laying on the hood of a car
Looking up at the stars with all the connections cut
Cause when you stuck, advantages vanishes
Bandages on the damages of what depression does
Sequestered cause, who are they to question us?
Beating up our ear drums like Question Love
With all of their requests from above
Press from below, only directions to bus
Thus we laying in the cut on the Cutlass Supreme
Looking up at the scene
Hoping it doesn’t cut, the fresh and the make up
Get re-fed the lines and reminded of what they mean
The importance of really acting like they important
And if you don’t feel ‘em you should force ‘em

Wishes that mend the broken heart
Fill the open palm, pardon my flow and thoughts
My departure from the norm, to parts that's more warm
War torn from the marchin' of your armies and the droppin' of your bombs
The walking on the waters now stomping on the pond
The ripples now a wave
It can’t be peaceful with a pistol in your face
You can’t beat the people so you picking on they place
I jump to defend, I wage with a page
My pen’s mightier than them and I got missiles on the stage
This couch is for the cowards and stretchers for the brave
And I happily lay upon the bed that I have made
Like house keep, sheets and pillow case
But I don’t sleep, dreams keeping me awake
They went up thinking they would never touch the ground
But we gon wish it ‘pon ‘em on the way back down

You would never know if you could ever be
If you never try, you would never see
Stayed in Africa, we ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy, or isn't he?
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything

Uh, and we ain't get exploited
White man ain't feared it so he did not destroy it
We ain't work for free, see they had to employ it
Built it up together so we equally appointed
First 400 years, see we actually enjoyed it
Constitution written by W.E.B. Du Bois
Were no reconstructions, civil war got avoided
Little black sambo grows up to be a lawyer
Extra extra on the news stands
Black woman voted head of Ku Klux Klan
Malcolm Little dies as an old man
Martin Luther King read the eulogy for him
Followed by Bill O'Reilly who read from the Quran
President Bush sends condolences from Iran
Where Fox News reports live
That Ahmadinejad wins the Mandela Peace Prize

Uh, and it ain't no projects
Keepin it real is not an understood concept
Yea, complexion's not a contest
Cause racism has no context
Hip-hop ain't got a section called conscious
Everybody rappin like crack never happened
Crips never occurred nor bloods to attack them
Matter of fact no hood to attack in
Somalia is a great place to relax in
Fred Astaire was the first to do a backspin
The Rat Pack was cool group of black men
That inspired the five white guys called the Jacksons
Eminem fitted in but then again
He inspired a black rapper tryin to mimic him
And thats what really rose up out of Michigan
The "sounding white" rapper by the name of 50 Cent

Uh, and I know it's just a fantasy
I cordially invite you to ask why can't it be
Now we can do nothing bout the past
But we can do something about the future that we have
We can make it fast or we can make it last
Every woman queen and every man a king and
When those color lines come we can't see between
We just close our eyes till its all black everything

You would never know
If you could ever be
If you never try
You would never see
Stayed in Africa
We ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery, call me crazy, or isn't he
See I fell asleep and I had a dream, it was all black everything

Uh, and we ain't get exploited
White man ain't feared so he did not destroy it
We ain't work for free, see they had to employ it
Built it up together so we equally appointed
First 400 years, see we actually enjoyed it
Constitution written by the W.E.B. Du Bois
Were no reconstructions, Civil War got avoided
Little black Sambo grows up to be a lawyer
Extra extra on the news stands

Malcolm Little dies as a old man
Martin Luther King read the eulogy for him
Followed by Bill O'Reilly who read from the Quran
President Bush sends condolences from Iran
Where FOX News reports live
That Ahmadinejad wins Mandela peace prize

Martin luther had a dream got a movie in my head and it's
So repetative so I think that it's time to tell em it
Who's ahead of it bun b would be the president
Cause all us texas boys id do it bigger than they ever did
Not so competitive nobody would be your nemesis
Ain't no devilish sinners doing what the devil did
A muslim sits at a coffee table with the methadist
Listen to method man talking tell em what the method is
Can do it effordless he would be who your professor is
Mr ice cubes who we use to watch the defacites
Just a brief case wouldn't have ta wear a vest with it
Saving in your cheque and bank account wouldn't be so decilate
And what's a pessimist every person would be gettin chips
Wayne and sean carter would be 2 people you would never diss
To make a living strippers wouldn't have to show there nakedness
They would make 6 figures just to serve a plate of beverages
Lil kim in the lab mixin like a chemist did
Nicki minaj she the potion tell her that she messed with it
No fighting with a record label to get levarage
Gucci mane would be the c.e.o and talk with eliquence
Just like elephants everybodies pockets hella thick
Koopa wonders this but for now well say it's tenative
Reality shows stars always show intelligence
And nobody would have to beef because we all be gettin rich

I know this this type of dream seems like a stretch
But everyone of us would be the best
With plenty of money
Yea everyone of us would see the change
And we would never have to worry bout dealing with stress
Cause really none of us would be depressed
We would do what we wanted
Ya couldn't tell me that that wouldn't be freshhhh

Uh, and I know it's just a fantasy I cordially invite you to
Ask why can't it be?
Now we can do nothing bout the past
But we can do something about the future that we have
We can make fast or we can make it last
Every woman Queenin' and every man a Kingin'
When those color lines come we can't see between
We just close our eyes 'til it's all black every-THING

Microphone check, I make em all bounce
Every teller in Bank of America, make em all count
You gone need the whole staff to add up the amount
It’s gonna take to pay me off to keep me out your house
To keep me in my zone so that I don’t zone out
I’m Rich and Po’ like Zone 4, thoughts is deep like Tone Loc
Walk with me like old folk, cross your street a score’s goal’ed
I don’t rap, I hockey rink cause my flow is so cold
I am on my “mmhmm,” they are on they “Oh, No!”
I am really in here, they ain’t real like Soul Glo
Don’t you know I’m so sho, them niggas got no Glow
Find a master ‘fore you can come back into the dojo
Lupe got his mind right, nigga this is my mic
And I’ve come to take it all back like Miller High Life
He must not be tied tight, back against the wall
He will throw a ball, like he playin’ Jai Alai
I’ll do the register, you just get them fries right
I don’t trust America, after watchin’ Zeitgeist
Take a look at my stripes, chest looks like a tiger arm
And I’m hot as tiger balm, fire like a five-alarm
And it’s set onto ya barn, Get ya fire-fighter on
I ain’t worried ’bout you hoes, I don’t even need to roll
I turn down your ex like how you put your tires on
Once I get these tires on, I buy a bomb and tie it on
And ride this around the entire song, find a line to drive it on
Park it near a metaphor, wait for it, the timer’s on
You can turn your hydrants on, I’ll just turn my wipers on
Wipe it off then wipe me down but don’t forget about my bomb!

Uh, it go like
You ever see the inner depths of a man's soul?
Or ninja turtles pouring out of manholes?
This is balance
Between a comic and a conscious, that's the challenge
Between the solitary and the conference that I examines
That I imagine was a figure
Would be the start of world peace and the transformation of niggas
Like the transubstantiation of liquor
But that's just turnin' them into blood
And we'll be right back where we was
Not a peace-sign, but a fascination with scissors
So I can cut
Myself off from the calculations of empress, empires, and the sinners
For advancement of human suffering
And other things trying to impede my publishing and editorials
That's gon' bring it back to us again
A boomerang minus Halle Barry and Eddie and everybody fucking and huh'

Shotgun
Even though independent cars ain't got one
I got some and more to spare
No more despair
My motor-ware don't match my motivate to mate
Also I drive to stay alive and ride this over there
My momma so mad, so no alcohol in here
I'm Aries Spears on my Jay-Z shit
Affion on the Drake skit
Now how many more can I make with just one voice
They might call it fake shit
This some deep shit
It's my me impersonatin' we shit
Vicariously in every rap I speak with
I hope you're speakin' for me, if I'm ever speechless
Cause I'mma be you
Even though you're not here to be with
I hope I see these gangsters actin' like teachers
Wake up out they sleep, dare to dream
In a world so Martin Luther King-less

And to my hero Heron, Gil Scott
In a discourse with Baldwin
On a jet plane with no fear for fallin'
But wishin' it never lands
Reminiscent of the dream time
Presently en route to the rise of the machine time
Magazine times
With coffee more sugar and milk than coffee
Aborted rhymes, rotten beats, and failed hooks
Roads as bumpy as braille books
Fail cools, bad French, and mad push at the door
Gourmet food at the starving soiree
A choice of one easy woman at a time
I'll take three the hard way
Trying to be as abstract as possible
And vulgar, the more shocking the more profitable
A baby fed molten gold
And sat upon a pedestal promote getting called 24 carot souls
How to describe this
Insightful remarks such as the best thing I've ever heard is silence
Some more technically impressive
In a faux Spanish romantic hues of a Marxist dialectic
Pleasing to the critics, but pointless is the common passerby
Might as well not even exist, not even a bit
In the event of my demise give everything I prize to the poor
And to the oppressors, I leave a war
And so on and so forth

Close your mind
Close your eyes
See with your heart
How do you forgive the murderer of your father?
The ink of a scholar is worth a thousand times more
Than the blood of a martyr

We came through the storm
Nooses on our necks and a smallpox blanket to keep us warm
On a 747 on the pentagon lawn
Wake up the alarm clock is connected to a bomb
Anthrax lab on a West Virginia farm
Shorty ain't learned to walk already heavily armed
Civilians and little children is especially harmed
Camoflouged Torahs, Bibles and glorious Qurans
The books that take you to heaven and let you meet the Lord there
Have become misinterpreted, reasons for warfare
We read 'em with blind eyes I guarantee you there's more there
The rich must be blind because they didn't see the poor there
Need to open up a park, just closed 10 schools
We dont need 'em
Can you please call the fire department they're down here marching for freedom
Burn down their tepees, turn their TV's on to teach 'em and Move!

The more money that they make the more money that they make
The better and better they live
Whatever they wanna take whatever they wanna take
Whatever whatever it is
The more that you wanna learn the more that you try to learn
The better and better it gets
American Terrorist!

Now the poor Ku Klux man see that we're all brothers
Not because things are the same because we lack the same color
And that's green, now that's mean
Can't burn his cross cause he can't afford the gasoline
Now if a muslim woman strapped with a bomb on a bus
With the seconds running give you the jitters?
Just imagine a American-based Christian organization
Planning to poison water supplies to bring the second-coming quicker
Nigga they ain't livin properly
Break 'em off a little democracy
Turn their whole culture to a mockery
Give 'em coca-cola for their property
Give 'em gum, give 'em guns, get 'em young, give 'em fun
If they ain't givin' it up, then they ain't gettin none
And dont give 'em all naw, man, just give 'em some
Its the paper, some of these cops must be Al-Qaeda nigga uh

It's like
Don't give the black man food, give red man liquor
Red man fool, black man nigga
Give yellow man tool, make him railroad builder
Also give him pan, make him pull gold from river
Give black man crack, Glocks and things
Give red man craps, slot machines
Now bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Don't give the black man food, give they red man liquor
Red man fool, black man nigga
Give yellow man tool, make him railroad builder
Also give him pan, make him pull gold from river
Give black man crack, Glocks and things
Give red man craps, slot machines

Through the fire, smoke, and broken rubble
Walks the secret life, bullet-proof and bulging muscle
Death-defying, highest flying over trouble
Can you please come and help us out our hopeless struggles?
Sympathy is wearing off and dying out
In the face of all these enemies and crying out
Losing all this energy from finding out
The world is filled with ills, ever so close to timing out

Pondering, that super-villain's got a point
Told the captain on the roof while they was smoking joints
Flicked the ashes down into the street below
Looked up, said he hate the city now, even though
He swore that he'd protect it when he landed
Their perspective's now changed, all pretty much abandoned
The captain spray cologne around and said he understand it
It's getting hard to separate the saints from the satanic

Where, are those heroes?
Where, are those super-heroes?

Last remarks, they did it to themselves
I killed off heaven, now I live in hell
So complicit in their own non-survival
Told them that they biggest rival is inside you
I do possess the power to revive you
But if I did that, I'd just have to fight you
Cause you truly are the hero and the villain
The world stood froze, hearing a truth so chilling
Reporters stopped filming, somebody shouted, "Kill him!"
He looked back in disgust and flew up through the ceiling
Busted through the roof and kicked over the building
Before it hit the ground, a younger hero flew around
And put it on his shoulders, said you're naive now
But believe, you'll believe me when you're older
Every asteroid you stop and bomb you fly up into space
You ain't saving them from danger, you're keeping danger safe
From the M-A...D-I to the S to the O-N
Po'in, to getcha open
Move like a nigga's supposed to get the dough
It'll go with the flow that I'm holdin'
Joe'n'em, they ownin' up - up on enough
Stay in the zone, that I go in
That I go in, when I go in and go in
Of the po'ins, and the rope man
Crucial conflict was smokin'
But a nigga like me, I don't be chokin'
So I proceed at low speed, low key
Like a OG in a '03 Loc-in'
Rollin' like a OZ in a b-leaf
Both pins, like a bowlin' ball when I ball
But I never fall for the oki-dokin'
Whitewalls and the slow-speed motion
Stash-box for the police pokin'
Rolie showin, shorty showin, Hokey Pokin'
Turnin it around with me to bust em down cuz they know he golden
Exactly; I'm in it from the minute I was in it
'til the minute that I spit it and I'm finished
And it's sad for me
Until the second wind, and reinvent it with a vengeance
Revisit and make 'em give it
Back to me

All right, that's all you get
I'm done
You know what I'm sayin'?
And the streets where they traffic me
Nigga what

Head to the sky, wings raised and
She's about to fly and take her place in
Out there in the stars when she leaves the ground
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around
But ain't no going back, this is how it must be
He told her she'll be burned alive, she just told him "trust me"
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Knowing that, he told her you wouldn't leave me if you loved me
And he knows that, because he knows her
Hard to hide his feelings, as it engulfs her
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays
A shooting out, a phoenix on fire burning up the nightscape
So lets hear it for our heroine
Applaud as her spirit just flies into the never-end
One closed chapter, it opens up another part
So this is more like the end, question mark

Carrera, raised in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle era
Water-bearer tell the truth, I dare ya
Ya lie, so eat this whole bottle of these jalapeño peppers
For terror made in America, too live
Fuck the property or give me my props properly
High off life this high technology, DeVry
I rep Muhammad Ali more like rapology
My policy’s not to be dishonestly deprived
So gimme that, gimme that, keep God
Where my city at, I’m like steak and fries but never die
They wanna Ghostface, wanna be me
But they will post-haste follow me into the after-life
That means you going right after I’ve
But I’m the hero sort of like Jack Sparrow
So some way, some how, I have survived
Ha ha, surprised
Who is he that we see coming over the tides
In a speed boat, boatload of pride
Fall of Rome, dress-shirted and mastermind tie
He what happens when rapping and avant garde fashion collides
OMG it's the C from the CRS LOLing at you haters
Tell your BFFs, like

Another day as I step out the door
Right past the poor in clothes they﻿ can't afford
For, this, I thank the Lord
Wish, that he'll bless me with a few more
Quick, cause working in a drought is a bitch
Switch, a female dog with no raw
Rich, is what I wanna get like gifts
But you need to blow to get ya birthday wish
Trip, and then you never snitch
You never tell a soul, not even a fish
Cause fish might fold, and run and tell the shrimp, ya dig?
And shrimp might run and tell the pigs
That you selling rides on the white horse right up out your crib
Bring﻿ the battering ram where you live
God, I really need a job, until I get it big, I be giving work to the kids
Dope Boy, streets is calling you

Another day as I step out the door
Right past the poor in clothes they can't afford
For this, I thank the Lord
Wish, that he will be bless me with a few more
Quick, cause working in a drought is a bitch
Switch, a female dog with no raw, rich
Is what I wanna get like gifts
But you need blow to get your birthday wish
Trip, and then you never snitch
You never tell a soul, not even a fish
Cause fish might fold, and run and tell the shrimp, ya dig?
And shrimp might run and tell the pigs
That you selling rides on the white horse right up out your crib
Bring﻿ the battering ram where you live
God, I really need a job, until I get a gig
I be giving work to the kids

Live by multiples and nines
So if it's nine and all, that shining ball, I'm all of y'all combined
Crybaby, that never miss, I bawling all the time
What's the cause of all this crying?
I ain't falling, I ain't hurt
But the man upstairs just sent me a bunch of work
Cut it in the studio then rap it in a verse
So low so them popo, man, I catch it in the search
But I'm stupid, I'm so smart, I ain't have it in the first
Might stop at the right block, if I'm paperless I might not direct
God is dope, Jesus my connect

Speaking to that fire, preaching to that choir
Open up that C, G-O-D is my supplier
Once it's lost, cut it soft, amazing when I heard that
Double up this fishscale, maybe bring all of these birds back
Feathers
Birds are returning to enjoy all this lovely weather
Never say never, said it so that won't happen ever
Ever so clever, yes sir, I get more coals than Weber
He cold, he cold, he cold, that's just means I'm getting better
Ego, ego, ego -- three birds are those three letters
Stop it, I'm just trying to find a prophet
Like I'm trying to line my pockets
With those fine designer wallets full of cheddar
Jesus (Chees'is) - like a picture full of teeth'is
Preachers -- I pulpit like a Michael Vick
Bless - God is dope, Muhammad my connect

O-V-E-R-D-O-S-E everything I does
Noah got a boatload that got shit from up above
Gotta pick a side because they fight a war on drugs
Well, you can tell 'em cartel cause I'm riding with my plug
Riding dirty, call it bible study
And I pray you keep them pigs up out my way
Because we eating like Ramadan in the evening
So we gotta re-up like five times a day
And faith is like the keys to the kingdom
And the yayo for the halo, got my triple beam leanin'
And an M3 with a trunk full of what everybody fiendin'
And my rearview mirror cool, I see no daredevils or demons
So God is dope, I'm slinging
David with the bricks, I'm kingpin
Trying to make me miss, they atheist
God is dope, serving like it's '86

Laid back, villain on the smooth tip
All things gravy, greatest fear to let the groove slip
Always tell the masses that it's never gon' stop
Cause you never gon' do shit
Magnify justice over long lost blues riffs
Mop up, sop up the tears for fears with a Q-tip
They proceeds to poke out they eyes with a toothpick
Remember when Larenz Tate beat Terrence with the pool stick
Or when Caine pistol whipped Chauncy and that fool snitched
Sent the tape to Bill Duke, would've went to jail
If he wouldn't have got killed in that drive-by by the dude he kicked
Cuz he was like, "It ain't mine"
And she was like, "You the only guy that I do it with"
Remember when 'Pac and Q start fightin' over Steel's house
They broke a vase, Steel scream, Raheem told 'em to chill out
The jheri curl Blood that bumped Ricky eating chips
The same guy they was looking for when Ice Cube stopped to let Cuba out the whip
And wan' it sad how Loco had the habit?
And wan' it funny when they caught T-Bone, dancing with that rabbit
Didn't Rocket have the same gun that the old man shot OG Bobby Johnson's son in the back with
Or do I got it backwards
And Bobby Johnson was the one that put his fist up to the glass
And Caine put his fist up and dapped it
And Chicago and Regina had sex inside the mail truck
They left his ass, he reached down to get his hairbrush
And Tré lied to Furious, sitting down get his hair cut

Yeah, do you remember these
Double burger with cheese
Double burger with cheese
Double burger with cheese, huh

Caine told him as he jacked him at the drive-thru
A hundred bucks will tell who Radames put the knife to
Another hundred for the cop who chased New Jersey Drive crew
The group who took Ricky ball, Crip or Piru
Kicked Doughboy and told him he could buy a hundred balls
Little Bobby used his bed to iron out his overalls
Who knew in a few he would have a gun aimed
Caine had a nigga's Daytons skatin' on his Mustang
Remember when the whole crowd stopped and got tense
Then they cheered when Steel put his hand up on the fence
Then when Gee Money first got married to the cocaine
And Chris Tucker OD'ed there watching Soul Train
Cam'ron shot him in the car and took his gold chain
Nino was free till he met up with that old man
And Ice-T was there and he oversaw the whole thing
Mello lost his legs just to get up out the dope game
Why he throw his gun into the river, though?
Just to hit the roof to get the juice and let Bishop go
Show Hodges love, but the Pac Man day came
'Specially after sprayed little ese with the spray paint
Remember when Bobby took off his tear
And when Doughboy disappeared
After his brother died and he said nobody cared
I still do, after all these years
Because he should've played ball
Ricky ain't deserve none of that at all
These are just a illustration
Of a few scenes that helped raise a generation

I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, you, you, you, you, tell me how do you feel
I just wanna be here alone, alone, alone
With you, you, you, you, you, tell me how do you feel

I don't wanna be here by myself
But I'm just like you, and you don't wanna be here by yourself
But I put my name on it, but you don't wanna end the friendship
And that's the declaration of independence
Would you lie for it? Would you die for it?
Put fireworks outside in that sky for it, would you wait for me?
You ain't gotta wait for me, wait 'til I come outside
Hop inside the ride and floor it, tell her she'll be safe with me
Where the shootin' stars, don't roll with them, you should stay with me
That's real shit, treadmill shit
I'm stressed though, but I feel shit
And babe I'm 'bout to go to work so these niggas gon' have to leave

And we all in this
Started up yourself a small business and we all in this
We has heels, no half steppin', all inches, high yield
Small inches, hell yeah, that's the loan that we owe some
But we pay the paper back out, same stacks, same money we just stole from 'em
That's real, that's steal
Like 4 to 2 and I look forward to you, lookin' down on the field
And you look 4'2", look forward boo, don't look down at your heels
Don't matter what's at stake, just let it burn, don't e'en look down at your grill
Either way we gon' ball, look around at your wheels
Even the baby gon' ball, look around at your wheels
Or just look inside how I look inside you, I look inside like I kill
And you just gon' have to be
And babe I'm 'bout to go to work so these niggas gon' have to leave

I'm fearless, now hear this, I'm earless
And I'm peerless, that means I'm eyeless
Which means I'm tearless, which means my iris
Resides where my ears is, which means I'm blinded
But I'mma find it, I can feel its nearness
But I'mma veer so I don't come near
Like a chicken or a deer, but I remember
I'm not a listener or a seer so my windshield smear
Here you steer, I really shouldn't be behind this
Clearly cause my blindness; the windshield is menstrual/minstrel
The whole grill is roadkill, so trill and so sincere
Yeah, I'm both them there
Took both pills, when a bloke in a trench coat
And the locs in the chair had approached him here
Made it clear as a ghost, so a biter of the throats in the mirror
The writer of the quotes for the ghosts
Who supplier of the notes to the living
Riveting as Rosie, pockets full of posies
Given to the mother of the deceased
Awake and at war 'til I'm resting in peace

And I'm mouthless, which means I'm soundless
Now as far as the hearing, I've found it
It was as far as the distance from the earring to the ground is
But the doorknockers on the ear of a stewardess in a Lear
She's fine and she's flying, I feel I'm flying by em
Cause my mind's on cloud nine and in a mine at the same time
Pimps see the wings on the Underground King
Who's also Klingon, to infinity and beyond
Something really stinks, but I Sphinx like Leon
Or lying/lion in the desert
I'm flying on Pegasus, you're flying on the pheasant
Writer of the white powder, picker of the fire flowers
Spit, "hot fiya" like Dylan on Chappelle's skit
Yeah, smell it on my unicorn
Don't snort the white horse, but toot my own horn
Sleep

You've been shedding too much light, Lu (Dumb it down!)
You make'em wanna do right, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're gettin self-esteem, Lu (Dumb it down!)
These girls are trying to be queens, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're trying to graduate from school, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're startin to think that smart is cool, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're trying to get up out the hood, Lu (Dumb it down!)
I'll tell you what you should do (Dumb it down!)

And I'm brainless, which means I'm headless
Like Ichabod Crane is
Or foreplay-less sex is, which makes me saneless
With no neck left to hang the chain with
Which makes me necklace-less, like a necklace theft
And I ain't used my headrest yet
They said they need proof like a vestless chest
About the best-fed F-F jet in the nest
Who exudes confidence and, excess depth
Even Scuba Steve would find it hard to breathe
Around these leagues; my snorkel is a tuba
Lu the ruler around these seas
Westside Poseidon, Westside beside 'em
Chest-high and rising, almost touching the knees
Of stewardess and the pilot, lucky they make ya fly wit
Personal floating devices, tricks falling out of my sleeves
David Blaine, make it rain
You make a boat, I make a plane
Then, I pull the plug and I, make it drain
Until I feel like flowing and filling it up again
Westside!

Bishop G, they told me I should come down, cousin
But I flatly refuse: I ain't dumb down nothing!

Yeah, What up, Chi-Town, New York City
Philly, Atlanta, Virginia
They said it was coming back around man
Back to the lyrics man
Come back to people like me, I say..

It's mean, soldiers
Now let me put the streets down like steamrollers
With the CATS that push
40 oz. through the hood like King Cobras
See we sling soda
Cause the extra four in the split is mixed
It's really thirty-six
Used to buy toasters and clips
You can tighten your circle or boa constrict
While you was lighting your purple, I was over the scripts
See, I could walk the walk, couldn't really talk the talk
Had to get my talk to properly explain my walk
Cause this lack in talk had my walk looking off
Now I'm over the limp
Watch how they mugs drop when they see my Verbal's able
That's the Usual
When I was po' I was low
Now me and my Chaps cop Purple Label
It's Ralph Lauren on the rap laureate
Niggas brown nose, they are like Alf to him
Runners at Interscope are not as Stoute as him
Please don't Interscope
It's gonna be a whole lot of Iovine and respirating
If I lean out this window with Irene
Niggas as tall as Yao Ming
With L-U-P-Emperor
Is the foundation's, I-beams and the antennas
It's so serious every time I write my John Hancock like
Could damn near see Detroit, I see you
Niggas is scared of heights
This is Saran Wrap and aluminum foil
Some potpourri, a little machine oil
I stack my paper and throw off my scents
This is top floor, better look out below
Pennies from heaven is the same as a semi from the second
And I reign supreme
Turn your umbrellas upside down
Did you even catch the change in theme

This is gangsta man
You don't gotta be no billionaireAnnotate
To get a ticket up to the moon
We all know somebody up there
You need a helping hand look up right here
To help you see clearly now yeah
To help you see clearly now yeah
I hope you see clearly now yeah
